            <li>4 ounces PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, well drained</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups KRAFT Shredded Low-Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese, divided</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons KRAFT Grated Parmesan Cheese, divided
            </li>
            <li>6 small boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>10 RITZ Crackers, crushed
            </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups spaghetti sauce, heated</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix cream cheese, spinach, 1 cup mozzarella and 3 Tbsp. Parmesan until well blended; spread onto chicken breasts. Starting at one short end of each breast, roll up chicken tightly. Secure with wooden toothpicks, if desired. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Beat egg in shallow dish. Mix remaining Parmesan and cracker crumbs in separate shallow dish. Dip chicken bundles in egg, then roll in crumb mixture. Place, seam-sides down, in 13x9-inch baking dish sprayed with cooking spray.</li>
          <li>Bake 30 min. or until chicken is done (165 degrees F). Remove and discard toothpicks, if using. Serve topped with spaghetti sauce and remaining mozzarella.</li>
